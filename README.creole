=== Description
This plugin allows the players on a server to add advertisement on a billboard, which can be considered by all the other players.

=== Storage
The billboard will be saved in a MySQL database, later on I will add SQLite support. An advertising consists of the name of the player, the date when it was created and the message.
If the billboard is saved in an MySQL database, you will be able to read it with PHP and show the BillBoard on a website.
